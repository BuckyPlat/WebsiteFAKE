  <h1>The ‘Godzilla’ of the Car Industry — The Legendary Nissan Skyline GT-R R32</h1>
  <h2>Born in ’89, The R32 GT-R Became Japan’s Most Iconic 90s Hero</h2>

      <h4>Power Unit: The RB26DETT</h4>
      <p>
        At the heart of the GT-R beats the legendary RB26DETT — a 2.6-liter inline-six engine with twin ceramic turbochargers and intercooler. 
        Officially rated at 280 PS at 6,800 rpm and 368 Nm of torque at 4,400 rpm, it quickly became known as a factory underdog. 
        In reality, the RB26 produced far more than Nissan admitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        This engine was designed with one goal: motorsport domination. Featuring a strengthened block, individual throttle bodies for each cylinder, 
        and advanced airflow management, it gave the R32 relentless power delivery both on the street and the racetrack.
      </p>

      <h4>4-Wheel Multi-Link Suspension & SUPER HICAS</h4>

        <p>
        The R32 GT-R was equipped with an advanced 4-wheel multi-link suspension system, designed to deliver superior stability, grip, and precise handling. 
        Compared to simpler suspension setups, the multi-link design allowed each wheel to operate independently, keeping optimal tire contact with the road surface. 
        This contributed to improved cornering performance and enhanced driver confidence, especially at high speeds.
        </p>

        <p>
        Adding to this was Nissan’s unique <strong>SUPER HICAS</strong> (High Capacity Actively Controlled Steering). 
        By electronically controlling the rear wheels, the system allowed them to steer in harmony with the front wheels. 
        At lower speeds, the rear wheels turned slightly in the same direction to improve agility and reduce steering effort. 
        At higher speeds, they adjusted to stabilize the vehicle during sharp or fast cornering, greatly enhancing safety and control.
        </p>

        <p>
        Together, the multi-link suspension and SUPER HICAS gave the R32 GT-R exceptional balance and cornering ability, making it a pioneer of advanced chassis technology in the early 1990s. 
        This combination of innovation and performance further cemented the GT-R’s reputation as a legend both on the road and the racetrack.
