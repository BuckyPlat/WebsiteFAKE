        <h1>The Racing Career of the Nissan GT-R R32</h1>
        <h4>The Birth of a Legend – “Godzilla”</h4>
        <p>
            The Nissan Skyline GT-R R32 made its debut in 1989 and quickly earned a fearsome reputation on race tracks around the world. 
            Thanks to its revolutionary ATTESA E-TS all-wheel-drive system and the RB26DETT twin-turbo engine, it dominated almost every motorsport series it entered.

            <h3>Group A Racing (1989–1993)</h3>
            <p>
                The R32 was built to conquer Group A racing — and it did. In Japan’s All Japan Touring Car Championship (JTCC), 
                it won <strong>29 out of 29 races</strong> between 1989 and 1993. 
                Its incredible grip and power forced officials to change the rules — a rare honor that showed how far ahead of its time it was.

            <h3>Australian Touring Car Championship</h3>
            <p>
                In Australia, the R32 GT-R’s performance was so overwhelming that the local press dubbed it <strong>“Godzilla”</strong> — 
                the monster from Japan that crushed everything in its path. 
                It dominated the Australian Touring Car Championship (ATCC), winning multiple titles and the prestigious <strong>Bathurst 1000</strong> in 1991 and 1992.

            <h3>24 Hours of Spa (1991)</h3>
            <p>
                The R32 GT-R also took its talents to Europe, entering the <strong>24 Hours of Spa</strong> endurance race in Belgium. 
                Despite facing seasoned European manufacturers, it performed brilliantly and proved that Japanese engineering 
                could compete on the world stage in endurance racing.

            <h3>Legacy and Influence</h3>
            <p>
                By the time production ended in 1994, the R32 GT-R had already become a legend. 
                Its technology and performance inspired the R33 and R34 generations and even shaped the design of the modern R35 GT-R. 
                Today, it’s considered a motorsport icon — a car that not only redefined performance but also introduced a new era of Japanese racing dominance.
